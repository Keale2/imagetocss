# imagetocss
Convert images to CSS box-shadows

# Usage
Navigate to the imagetocss directory in your terminal, and run: `node index.js link.png`

To increase step from 1 (default), pass another parameter: `node index.js link.png 10`

*increasing step will make your image look dumb*

**Even an image as small as 100x100 can make 10,000 box-shadows... Beware.**
